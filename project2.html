                In my third year of the undergraduate, my school(Dalian University of Technology) arranged the student in the electrical information engineering department to go to a technology company for a internship(more like a class). When we are studying there, we need to stay there for the whole day. However, the teacher tried to make us finish the job in the class.

        <h2>The progress</h2>
        <div class="para">
            <p>
                At first, the teacher told us that our final mission is to design a app that can control the on/off of the electronic furniture in the home based on the environment parameter. Then the teacher taught us some basic operation, such as how to using the VSCODE to control the on/off of the LED on STM32 which stands for the electronic furniture, how to send the on/off order using the server and how to obtain the command from the server using the VSCODE. Besides, the teacher also taught us how to obtain the environment parameter using the sensor and how to design the interface of the app. 

                In the stage of the final work, something happened to our group, three of our group member are busy with the qualification of the graduate student, so there were only three of us finishing the work which was assigned to 6 people. My job was to design the interface of the app and to obtain the order from the web-server. After finishing my part, I also helped to make sure the LED can be turned on/off following the command from the web-server using the VSCODE.

                Finally, we made the presentation, although our groupâ€™s work was not so successful, the teacher still spoke highly of the three of us who struggled to finish the work.
