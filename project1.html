            <p>
                In this project, we have learn many basic things about the digital image processing such as some basic operation of the image using matlab such as 'imread' and the basic component of the image such as the RGB , YCbCr and also the gray scale.

        <h2>The progress</h2>
        <div class="para">
            <p>
                After we have learned the basic knowledge of the digital image processing, the professor taught us something deeper and harder such as the various kind of filter, DCT(Discrete Cosine Transfrom) and even edge-detecting. We need to attend the online-lecture and finish the assignment every week, which took a lot of time .It is difficult to learn at first. However, I still make it through.

        <h2>The End</h2>
        <div class="para">
            <p>
                And our final work is to use all all the knowledge that we learned to complete various kinds of mission that the professor assigned to us and we also need to make a presentation about how we complete those missions and the result of the missions. It took me a lot of time to review the knowledge I learned and it also took time to finish all the requirements that the teacher proposed. Finally, it took me a few days to practise the presentation. In the end, I performed well and I obtained the recommendation letter from the professor.
